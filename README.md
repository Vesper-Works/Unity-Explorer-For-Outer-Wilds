This mod is an implementation of [Unity Explorer](https://github.com/yukieiji/UnityExplorer) for Outer Wilds.

# Interactable Gizmos
This works with the currently selected GameObject in the Inspector.

Press `R` to cycle between no gizmos, `Local Position`, and `Local Rotation` gizmos.

Press `T` to
- in `Local Position` mode go from actual local position to using the transform orientation
- in `Local Rotation` mode toggle a rotation wheel that always looks at the camera

This feature is still in beta, so expect some weirdness. [Report any issues you find](https://github.com/Vesper-Works/Unity-Explorer-For-Outer-Wilds/issues/new).

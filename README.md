This mod is an implementation of [Unity Explorer](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer) for Outer Wilds.

# Interactable Gizmos
This works with the currently selected GameObject in the Inspector.

Press `R` to cycle between none, local position, and local rotation.

Press `T` to
- in Local Position mode go from actual local position to using the transform orientation
- in Local Rotation to toggle a rotation wheel that always looks at the camera

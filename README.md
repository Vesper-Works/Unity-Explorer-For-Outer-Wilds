This mod is an implementation of [Cinematic Unity Explorer](https://github.com/originalnicodr/CinematicUnityExplorer) for Outer Wilds.

# New binds
The default keybinds may overlap with buttons from cheats mods (it uses numpad). Check the `Options` tab to change the binds and the [guide](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/cinematic-unity-explorer.htm#hotkeys) to see the defaults.

The guide in general has [useful tips](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/cinematic-unity-explorer.htm#tips-tricks-and-common-questions) for using Unity Explorer.

# Interactable Gizmos
This works with the currently selected GameObject in the `Inspector` tab.

Press `U + R` to cycle between no gizmos, `Local Position`, and `Local Rotation` gizmos.

Press `U + T` to
- in `Local Position` mode go from actual local position to using the transform orientation
- in `Local Rotation` mode toggle a rotation wheel that always looks at the camera

This feature is still in beta, so expect some weirdness. [Report any issues you find](https://github.com/Vesper-Works/Unity-Explorer-For-Outer-Wilds/issues/new).
